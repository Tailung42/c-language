## emoji
---
this was the first program that made fall in love with programming.
One day I was in a bus , returning home from school thinking about 
nested for loop that was able to print a rectangle of #'s ( the code 
I saw was in C#) and then it clicked it . It felt like I'd discovered 
something brand new . The fact that you can make grid in terminal (didn't 
even know it was called terminal). And then I came home, started tinkering 
with what I'd discovered. I made circles(solid and bordered) and experimented 
with different conditions and then I thought of making a smile emoji in my terminal

** I learned  how important maths is in programming ** because when I made it ( in c#
back then) writing code was the last thing and the most easiest one. I loved with the
problem solving side of it.
**for the first time i wrote my original program no tutorial no help from anone , I 
had done all by myself**.Nowadays i don't feel like I'm programming . I'm just using what 
others made
